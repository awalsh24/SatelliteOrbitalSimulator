C++ Satellite Orbital Simulator
This project simulates the orbital motion of satellites around a central body ( Earth). It was developed during my semester abroad (August - December 2024) as a way to improve my C++ programming skills and explore orbital mechanics.


Features:
Implements core orbital mechanics concepts based on Keplerian physics.
Reads Two-Line Element Data (TLE) from a public source (https://www.celestrak.org/NORAD/elements/) to simulate real-world satellite positions.


My Learning Experience:
Developing this project allowed me to:
Deepen my understanding of C++ concepts, even without a formal course.
Explore the world of orbital mechanics and its underlying physics.
Leverage real-world data from TLE files to simulate realistic scenarios.


Future Development:
This is an ongoing project with plans to incorporate a user-friendly GUI to enhance its functionality.


Collaboration:
The project source code is open-source and available for forking. Feel free to contribute and build upon this foundation!

Note:
This project prioritizes functionality over code optimization. However, feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
